# Physical Fields [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mglaman/physical.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mglaman/physical)

The physical fields provides a way to give entities field with measurable values - such as weight and volume.

## Currently defined fields:
* Physical weight: enter a weight value with its unit of measurement (lb, oz, kg, or g); supports locking the unit of measurement on the field edit form so it cannot be changed on product edit forms.
* Physical volume: enter values for length, width, and height with their unit of measurement (in, ft, mm, cm, or m); also supports locking the unit of measurement like the weight field.

## Fields to implement

* Abstract the components from dimensions
  * Length
  * Width
  * Height
